Inverted monopoly with aliens (i.e. negative feedback loop)

Single player game
Defend your owned estates
Dice roll to move
Option to claim, defend, or move on, at each territory.
Turn based, 10x10 board. Maybe not a ring.

Zombies spread through neighbourhoods.
Neighbourhoods have residents.

You win when you own the whole map.  You lose when everyone is
dead. You never die.  Buildings initially have survivors in them. Once
you've taken a building, the survivors are now exposed. If you don't
defend the building in time, that person dies.

Options:
- Left/Right
- Wait

Maybe:
- accelerated speed (bike?)
- fortifications (hotels?)
- chance/jail
- boss?

Buildings of same colour are blocks that survivors can move through;
they give you time to arrive. The equivalent of chance/community is
open areas. Stations when uncovered are fast travel. Utilities need to
be some kind of boost.

Maybe just simple vector colour graphics. A nice font, high
res. Initial fog of war.

What if survivors die on contact with aliens? And the aliens move
randomly, but will flee from the player? The game then becomes a
rescue mission.

Randomly generating boards would be fairly easy.
