Glorious Leader
---------------

A very basic entry for Ludum Dare 40.

You play the glorious leader, in his big black car, fleeing an alien
attack on the city. You must escape the city to win. As you flee,
citizens will emerge from hiding to flee behind you. You're faster
than they are, but the aliens are faster than all of you.

This is a turn based game, with a half second turn timer (a turn happens
automatically twice a second).

The controls are:
- cursor left: reverse
- cursor right: forward
- enter: wait a turn
- space: issue orders

The aliens are faster than you are. The only way to make good your
escape is to use the efforts of your citizens.

Red citizens are soldiers. Red city blocks are defensible positions
that you can tell them to hold. The taller the city block, the longer
it will take the aliens to reduce it, if it is defended.

Green citizens are engineers. Green city blocks are power stations,
that you can tell them to man. When the power's on, the speed of the
aliens is much reduced. The engineers will have to stay behind. The
taller the block, the bigger the generator, and the longer power
lasts.

Blue citizens are scientists. Blue city blocks are teleporters, that
you can order them to activate. They will have to stay behind, but you
will leap forward. The taller the block, the further forward you will
leap.

The citizens are the only thing that can save you, but more citizens
also provoke more aliens to chase you, and citizens not defending a
point don't slow the aliens down at all.
